<h1>5th of March 2023</h1>
<p>Today was a pretty good day, I deleted Discord and actually got some things done. <br>Today I tried out my skills with watercolours and it wasn't all too bad. I made some masterpieces that I'm proud of. I might buy a professional watercolour kit just for the funs of it. I will add my masterpieces here.</p>

<p>Other than that I got my vocabulary done, coded this website and got a P4 paper done. Today was  overall a good day and I didn't feel like I was behind on anything. Though I do wish I did phyiscs... Maybe tomorrow? Who knows :) <br> Sherly out !</p> <br>
